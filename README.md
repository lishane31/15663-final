C++ implementation of real-time around-the-corner imaging.

# Installation Instructions
This library requires OpenCV 3 and CMake

To make and run, create `build` directory and cmake from there:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

(because it's better practice to have a build tree separate from
the actual source tree)

# Installing Dependencies
